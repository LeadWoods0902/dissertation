Host Device:
    Wi-Fi P2P Setup:
        announce its presence via Wi-Fi P2P service discovery
        Handle Wi-Fi P2P connection events, such as connection establishment and disconnection.

    Database Monitoring:
        Implement a mechanism (e.g., background service, LiveData observer) to monitor changes in the Room database.
        Upon detecting database changes, prepare and format the data to be distributed to client devices.

    Data Distribution:
        When new data is available for distribution, broadcast a Wi-Fi P2P message or signal to connected client devices.
        Include necessary information in the broadcast (e.g., data payload, timestamp) to facilitate data synchronization on client devices.

Client Device:
    Wi-Fi P2P Setup:
        Discover and establish a connection with the host device using Wi-Fi P2P.
        Handle Wi-Fi P2P connection events, such as connection establishment and disconnection.

    Broadcast Reception:
        Implement a mechanism (e.g., broadcast receiver, service) to listen for Wi-Fi P2P broadcasts from the host device.
        Upon receiving a broadcast indicating new data availability, initiate data synchronization with the host device.

    Data Synchronization:
        Establish a communication channel with the host device for data exchange (e.g., socket connection).
        Receive and process the distributed data payload from the host device.
        Update the local Room database with the received data to synchronize with the host.

    Error Handling and Recovery:
        Implement error handling mechanisms to handle communication failures or network issues gracefully.
        Include retry logic and error recovery strategies to ensure robustness and reliability of the data synchronization process.


Host Device:
1. Register a broadcast listener
2. Request a scan
